# Special Properties: Delay and Repeat

Special properties define how the animation should run and what it should do. Special properties are not animated.

`delay`: how much time should transpire before animation begins

`repeat`: how many times the animation should repeat

`yoyo`: when set to true the animation will play back and forth

`repeatDelay`: how much time should transpire between each repeat

&#x20;An animation will repeat indefinitely if you set `repeat: -1`
