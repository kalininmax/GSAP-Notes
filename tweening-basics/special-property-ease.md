# Special Property: Ease

An ease controls the rate of change as your animation plays.

In simple uses an ease will control whether your animation slows down or speeds up.

An ease can be applied on the way out (default), on the way in, or both directions.

The steeper the curve the faster change is taking place.&#x20;

`ease: 'bounce'` will bounce on the way out

`ease: 'bounce.in'` will bounce on the way in

`ease: 'bounce.inOut'` will bounce on the way in and out

Some eases can be configured

`ease: 'back(6)'` will have a stronger overshoot
